Energy Interactive Artwork

An interactive floor projection created in Processing and MaxMsp.
The particles in the animation respond to the brightest point as detected by a webcam. On the night this was a clear umbrella & torch.
Speakers attached to the umbrella also responded to the partipants location on the ground.

The first interation on desktop (responding to mouse location):
